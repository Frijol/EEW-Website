## EEW Data Tools & Workshop Structure
ECHO includes compliance data on air, water, and hazardous waste laws for all facilities permitted to emit, store, and use hazardous materials along with data on inspections and enforcement actions taken by EPA and state agencies. It is the first database to publicly share federal environmental enforcement data. However, the website itself can be hard for non-specialists to use and understand. To increase ECHO’s public accessibility, the EEW team is developing a series of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAWoUbsISSV-tFZvASbTDE6KRl6Hkeu4p-N2jpQFmt0/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank >[Jupyter Notebooks</a> – collaborative, open-source data analysis tools – so people can use this information from ECHO to make customizable reports on pollution from facilities in areas of interest. 

These reports can include information about EPA inspections of these sites, whether facilities are complying with federal regulations, and if EPA has responded to violations with enforcement actions. We’ve already written the code to generate reports based on the data—during the workshops, participants simply *run* the notebook to generate a report for their area of interest. **No coding or data science experience is needed!**

We are developing Notebooks to generate several different types of reports: analyzing inspections, violations, enforcement actions, and greenhouse gas emissions by zip-code, congressional district, and county; or investigating a facility of concern across regulatory statutes. We are developing other specialized Notebooks, including one about declining enforcement during the COVID-19 crisis, and we will work with partner organizations to make notebooks for questions they want answered. We want to make environmental compliance data more accessible and useful through our Jupyter Notebooks and supplementing the numbers with community stories, compelling data visualizations, and contextual research.

## You Can EEW Too
Importantly, these workshops are not meant to center EDGI or the EEW team. Rather, we hope that every workshop will be co-hosted by one or more partner organizations: community groups, national environmental watchdogs, research hubs, and everything in between. We are here to help you answer pressing questions and create materials and networks that support your advocacy and organizing efforts.

EEW workshops begin with collective report-making through the Jupyter Notebooks, followed by breakout sessions into different tracks (Storytelling, Research and Contextualization, Data Visualization, and Data Science) based on participants’ own skills and interests. The outcomes of the various tracks will then be compiled into a single report that is informative, visually interesting, and oriented toward community action. We strongly encourage and can help facilitate EEW partners in developing other creative demonstrations and outcomes from these workshops.

EEW workshops will help highlight: 

* whether local facilities are violating their permits to emit hazards into air and water
* what companies are emitting – including greenhouse gas emissions
* the public health risks associated with these emissions
* what is and isn’t being tracked 
* errors in environmental data and corporate reporting
* whether EPA has taken any enforcement action

We hope to compile EEW-generated reports, actions, and other outcomes into an interactive map or repository in order to demonstrate the power of collective action and data stewardship in addressing unchecked environmental violence.
