## Why Enforcement Matters
The EPA is mandated by Congress to enforce environmental laws. With the EEW workshops, we aim to draw attention to the large gaps in effective enforcement of environmental laws. By mobilizing community expertise, public engagement and education, compelling material evidence, and an ethic of care, we can pressure our elected officials and local industries to put health and justice before power and profit.

According to Cynthia Giles, former Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, over 25% of all registered facilities are regularly in significant violation of their environmental permits across all programs with available compliance data. And, for programs with the most significant health impacts, “significant violation rates of 50-70% are not unusual” (<a href="http://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Cynthia-Giles-Part-2-FINAL.pdf" target=_blank >Harvard Law School</a>). Significant non-compliance happens when industries emit hazardous pollutants or fail to report emissions over their permit limits for 6+ months consecutively. Non-compliance has always been an issue and has ramped up even further due to the erosion of EPA funding and enforcement under the Trump Administration (<a href="https://envirodatagov.org/publication/a-sheep-in-the-closet-the-erosion-of-enforcement-at-the-epa/" target=_blank >EDGI</a>). Between 2006 and 2018, enforcement funding and staff dropped by 18% and 21% respectively (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf" target=_blank >EPA</a>). Between 2007 and 2018, both initiated and concluded enforcement actions dropped by more than 50% (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_20200331_20-p-0131_0.pdf" target=_blank >EPA</a>). Now more than ever, local regulators and affected communities are unable to hold polluters accountable to longstanding laws. 

Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income communities – among other historically marginalized groups – face disproportionate exposure to hazardous waste sites and polluting industries (<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780896084469" target=_blank >Bullard & Wright</a>). These industries have undue influence in the writing and development of regulations, leading to emissions standards that are not health-protective (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/18/pfoa-pfas-teflon-epa-limit/" target=_blank >The Intercept</a>). Even still, many industrial facilities fail to comply with these insufficient regulations. The financial penalties for doing so represent just a small fraction of their profits in the unlikely case that these penalties are enforced at all. This crisis of non-compliance, coupled with already-inadequate regulations, represents a systematic and deliberate choice to ignore environmental and human health. We aim for EEW workshops to call attention to these systematic gaps in enforcement using available public data from the ECHO website.

## About EEW Report Cards
The <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/" target=_blank >Senate Environment and Public Works Committee</a> and the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/" target=_blank >House Energy and Commerce Committee</a> have jurisdiction over the EPA. The EPA is mandated to enforce environmental laws such as the:

* Clean Water Act (CWA)
* Clean Air Act (CAA)
* Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

![A cycle diagram demonstrating how Congress mandates EPA, the EPA issues and enforces permits to facilities that pollute, the ECHO database stores compliance data about these facilities, EEW makes ECHO data easier to understand and EEW works with communities to make environmental compliance report cards which pushes on congress to enforce environmental enforcement through the EPA](./report-card-tracker.png)

EEW Report Cards analyze and present data on violations of environmental laws, inspections of polluting facilities, and enforcement actions by the EPA for the congressional districts of each Representative on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the State of each Senator on the Environment and Public Works Committee. Our goal is to shed light on the chronic and routine violations of environmental laws and the failure to enforce environmental laws.
